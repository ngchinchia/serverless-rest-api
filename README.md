Secure REST API for User Data Submission and Retrieval
A serverless REST API built on AWS & serverless framework, designed to handle user data securely. The API supports both data submission and retrieval and includes comprehensive security measures to protect against common attacks. The architecture follows a variation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.

:beginner: About
This project is a secure REST API designed to handle user data submissions through a serverless architecture utilizing AWS services. The API allows submission of various data types (text, email, boolean, phone number) and securely stores and retrieves this data. It is built with security best practices in mind, including protection against SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and DDoS attacks.

:zap: Usage
This section outlines how to use the REST API.

:triangular_ruler: Architecture
This project follows a variation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern adapted for a serverless environment. The components are organized to promote a clear separation of concerns:

Controller: Handles incoming HTTP requests and directs them to the appropriate service methods.
Service: Contains the business logic and validation, processing data before it reaches the repository.
Repository: Manages data persistence, interacting with the database to perform CRUD operations.
Model: Defines the data structures and schemas used throughout the application.
Handler: Serves as the entry point for AWS Lambda functions, integrating with the Serverless framework.

2	service.mjs	Service: Implements business logic, validation, and calls the repository methods
3	repository.mjs	Repository: Handles all database interactions (CRUD operations)
4	model.mjs	Model: Defines data schemas and structures used in the application
5	handler.mjs	Handler: Entry point for Lambda functions, routes requests to the appropriate controller
:hammer: Build
To build and deploy the project to AWS:

Deploy using Serverless Framework:

bash
Copy code
serverless deploy
Access the deployed API via the API Gateway URL provided after deployment.

:lock: Security
Security features implemented in the API:

Input Validation: All input data is validated server-side to ensure integrity and avoid common attacks.
Rate Limiting: AWS API Gateway is configured with rate limiting to protect against DDoS attacks.
Encryption: Sensitive data is transmitted over HTTPS and stored encrypted in the database.
Sanitization: Inputs are sanitized to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
CSRF Protection: Implemented CSRF tokens or use of same-origin policies to protect against CSRF attacks.
Notifications: An email notification is sent upon successful data submission.

:question: FAQ
How does the MVC pattern apply in a serverless architecture?

In this project, the MVC components are adapted to fit serverless functions:

Model: Data schemas and models used by the application.
View: Since this is an API, the "View" is represented by the HTTP responses.
Controller: Manages incoming requests and interacts with services.
Service: Contains the business logic, acting as an intermediary between controllers and repositories.
Repository: Handles data persistence.
How do I ensure secure data transmission?

All API endpoints use HTTPS, and sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.

What database can I use with this project?

You can choose between SQL databases like Amazon RDS (MySQL, PostgreSQL) or NoSQL databases like DynamoDB, depending on your data requirements.
