Secure REST API for Membership Data Submission
This project implements a secure REST API for handling membership data, using a serverless architecture with AWS services. The API enables data submission via a form and supports secure data handling and retrieval with encryption and validation.

:beginner: About
This project implements a secure REST API that collects, validates, and stores data from a membership sign-up form. It supports various data types like text, email, boolean, and phone numbers. Security measures like encryption, rate limiting, and validation are included to protect data and prevent attacks like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.

:triangular_ruler: Architecture
This project follows a modified MVC design pattern (Model-View-Controller) with additional layers for services and repositories. It is built on a serverless architecture using AWS services (e.g., Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB).

Key Features:
Data Submission: API endpoint to submit form data.
Data Retrieval: API endpoint to fetch submitted data.
Security: Implements encryption, validation, and rate limiting.
Notifications: Triggers a notification (email or message) upon successful data submission.

:closed_lock_with_key: Security
Encryption: Data submitted through the API is encrypted during transmission and stored securely in DynamoDB.
Validation: Server-side validation ensures that only valid data is accepted.
Rate Limiting: Prevents DDoS attacks by limiting the number of API calls.
Best Practices: Following OWASP security guidelines to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF.
